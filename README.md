I built an age classification model using PyTorch. For the architecture, I used a ResNet50 backbone because it provides a good balance between depth and performance. The dataset was organized in folders named after assessment_excercise_test (e.g., "20", "21", etc.), so it was easy to extract age labels.
All input images were resized to 224Ã—224 and normalized using standard ImageNet mean and standard deviation. I split the data into 80% training and 20% validation. The model was trained for 25 epochs, but training took a lot of time due to limited hardware.
